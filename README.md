# this is a Clojure-friendly emacs config

If you're new to emacs, check out
[this introductory tutorial](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)!

This config was derived from [my personal emacs config](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d/)

I've tried to separate everything logically and document the purpose
of every line. [`init.el`](./init.el) acts as a kind of table of
contents.  It's a good idea to eventually go through `init.el` and the
files under the `customizations` directory so that you know exactly
what's going on.
